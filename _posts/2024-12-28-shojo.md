# Demographics in manga 
If you new to manga, you may never heard of the 4 major demographics of manga. They are **Shonen** (targeted at young boy), **Shojo** (for teenage girl), **Seinen** and **Josei** are for adults men and woman respectively. 

It safe to say that Shonen is now the face of manga/anime world wide with popular title such as: "One Piece", "Jujutsu Kaisen", "Demon Slayer", "Attack on Titan" and many more. Although famous for its action series, shonen magazine also contain different gerne as well. For example, the romance-comedy or rom-com and it's sub gerne Harem manga. 

Despite its original target, shonen anime/manga is well loved by all genders and ages. Stories are simple almost formulaic yet it work so well in capturing people's hype and excitements. But what about Shojo? Compare the numbers of title publish Shojo manga is more than Shonen by a significant margin (about 1500 titles according to My Anime List database). It's still sell well and certainly has it's own dedicated fanbase but definitely don't have the universal appeal that Shonen have. 

When talk about Shojo people often associated it with romance. Although they are intertwine, romance is just one gerne of it, just like action is to Shonen. So this blog is my documented journey to explore the world of Shojo manga. Hopefully it's entertaining and makes you want to pick up something fresh and different to your normal taste.  
# My problems with shonen rom-com

When I started reading manga, I mostly read read shonen rom-com. They are entertaining, but they never felt truly satisfy. The characters only confess after 200+ chapters of funny shenanigans. Then the series just end, and we the reader are left with only a few pages to say good bye to the characters. This happen so often, it felt like these author do not believe in love after confession. 

Of course there are some exception. My favorite is ‚ÄúKaguya-sama-love is war‚Äù. Purely because Aka Akasaka went extra mile after the confession and the group dynamic is lovely. Although the way he resolve the final conflict is more on the comedic side, but I appreciate it nonetheless. Another manga called: "The fragrant flowers bloom with dignity" is also well praise. It provide plenty of intimacy moments and the main couple actually trying to know each others. You would think all of the thing I mentioned above should be the bare minimum for a romance story, but in reality series like this are the exception not the norm in the Rom-com genre.

It seem like whenever there is a comedy tag, the story focus much more on the entertaining aspect rather than romance, and its even more evident in Harem manga. In this kind of stories, there are multiple love interest and the main character will choose one girl at the end (often dub the winning girl by the community).  

As a guy, I will be lying if I said this stuff doesn't appeal to the male fantasy XD but sometime the way they write females character in this can be very jarring to read. Also, the fact that you select one girl at the end despite flirting with 10 of them, makes the main character look like a jerk as well. Of course, these are meant to be entertaining piece, read in short bites, feature cute anime girls with quirky personalities. Most people won't expect perfect writing to come from this and I think so too.

What about normal shonen romance then, let‚Äôs remove the comedy tag to see it will solve anything. The answer is yes, there are some amazing works like ‚Äúa silence voice‚Äù, ‚Äú3 days of happiness", etc. However they are focus more on the drama, life lesson side of thing rather than telling a love story. Here is when Shojo shine, it has always been well known because of it's romance. 

When searching for a different flavor of romance. That's when I came across this video "[I Forced Myself to Read Shojo Manga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGLxEZehTfM)". I got hook when he talk about this series called "Yona of the Dawn". Apparently, it is the highest rated Shojo of all time and I've never heard of it even once. 40 volumes later, and this might be the best thing I have every read.

You know the f\*\*k up thing is? "Rent a girlfriend" (yeah that is the title of the show, not an insult) has a 3 seasons anime adaptation and probably will have more in the future. This never got a season 2. I am literally in tears right now.
# My first manga: Yona of the dawn.
I can write about this series till next year. I even purposely not keeping up with the latest chapter to wait for the ending. For now I will try to highlight some of the key thing I really enjoy to hopefully inspire you to give it a chance. It will be spoiler free so you don't have to worry. 
- The main character: Often in shonen the main character get stronger and solve everything using their power. To me that's kind of pathetic. Problems doesn't go away just because you are the strongest. What I like is, even though Yona have some of the strongest warriors by her side. This series managed to make her shine the brightest. 
- World building: The world of ‚ÄúYona of the Dawn‚Äù is genuinely intriguing. It has many factions, areas and nations each have their own of operate. Everything really feel alive and not just a place to tell the main character stories. Through Yona eyes, we gets to see this amazing world bit by bit. If you love your political drama, trust me you will enjoy this. 
- The romance sub plot: It is somehow better than some story that only focus on romance. It very much enhance the characters. The feelings of these characters can not sum up using a simple diagram, it evolve through time. This is what I felt lacking in some romance stories. Love is complex as the people are, and this series fully encapsulated that
- The fluffy feelings that are indescribable: You read this in Yona point of view, every time a guy getting closer I can feel my chest getting tighter. It's a bit weird at first, but I'm fully embrace it now üòÜüòÜüòÜ. Not gonna lie, it kind of awoke something in me, like I also want to be hugged and cared by people around. I'm straight, I swear, If not my parents is gonna kill me üòÜüòÜüòÜ.
- The author notes: The official English release also translated the author notes. Most of the time, it gave great insight into the creating process, others time it just really fun. I remember one chapter she just straight up talks about her favorite TV show. It feels like a fun blog in the middle of your manga.
- And so many more things I can't name at the top of my head: The combat action, the art work it self, and many more...

Yona also really opened up the world of shojo manga for me. With Shonen there are a lot of "good" series but the incredible one are so few and far in between. For example, something like Hunter x Hunter, how many shonen series can we confidently say that are up to that level? Not many, I can't even name 3 on top of my head. With shojo there are so much series that tick all the right boxes. The fact that there is a sea full of stories like this make me so exciting.
# My 2nd manga: Colette just want to die
![reddit img|600](https://preview.redd.it/another-retelling-i-reccomend-is-collette-decides-to-die-v0-3a6g0v5y7nfb1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=21cf3d829a18c2e49acf3583acb2e9612a7ba586)
I binge everything available within 2 days. This time I read the Fan Translation, it stops at Vol. 15. It was really good. On the surface the stories can not be more simple, just cute, wholesome Romance. But the attention to details is impeccable. It's like you turn the cuteness dial up to eleven, even the skeleton are cute. All the gods, are very likable while still maintaining their quirkiness from the lore. There's a lot of life lesson as well. Although, they are presented in a very light-hearted way and not on the nose like some often series do. Romance wise, as usual you can always count of shojo to deliver intimacy, couple's moments. I'm super excited for the official release coming soon can't wait to read the ending.
# My 3rd manga: Sailor moon
![sailor moon|600](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fe/fd/d5/fefdd5c1f34b0eaead29e1bc819104b1.jpg)
I wound't consider myself to be properly into shojo If I haven't read a single magical girl manga. I choose Sailor Moon, and this series certainly does not need any introduction. As of now I only read the first two volume. I must say I did not expect everything to be moving so fast. In the span of 2 volume, we manage to gather all 4 sailors, awoken everyone's power, beat the bad guy and reveal the sad back stories. But the most shocking of all, sailor moon meet tuxedo mask and they immediately recognize their feeling for each others. You know coming from Rom-com pacing to this is really refreshing. If this was written by a Shonen Jump author you bet they would take 200 chapter to do these things.

I like pretty much everything as of now. Maybe the eyes are too big for my taste but that's about it. I think I will switch over to the anime, should be even more magical with all the colors. It‚Äôs definitely harder to read this tho, because of the overdosing magical girl energy. But that's just a me problem, If you grew up watching Sailor Moon will certainly enjoy the manga.   
# My 4th manga: In the clear moonlit dusk
![Reddit img2|600](https://preview.redd.it/in-the-clear-moonlit-dusk-art-appreciation-v0-wlt88tzz9fxd1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4a1d0801786af8791d08575177d2db2b0b174044)
This one is a bit weird for me. Overall I still very much enjoy it. Really dig the art, and the main girl design. We need to bring short hair tomboy girl back man. 

She definitely take less initiation than the others shojo protagonist that I read. This time is the main guy who doing all the attack. I don't really know why, but this guy give me bad vibe. Maybe because he is a bit too good with girl. I don't know about most guy, but I get nervous when taking the initiate and this guy just do it flawlessly. He's also a bit forceful at time. Do girls like that? I'm confuse.

To summarize, Is sweet, is beautiful, definitely worth checking out. Compare to the last three I read this is the most "normal" one. No fantasy elements, no actions just two high schooler who like each other.     
# Some series I struggle to get into.
A condition call love. This is about a girl who never interested in romance and a guy who is very over-committed to the point that is scary.   

Okay, the guy is just too much. I know that‚Äôs the whole point but its can be unbearable as a guy to read this. It hit too close to home for me and definitely a lot of boy out there. When you really like someone, you do the cringiest thing ever. 

I think this series really try to delve deep into the questions of "what is mean to love someone and what is like to be in a relationship?". I do think if you can get through the beginning the paid off is worth it. There are 11 volume out right now, and a 12 eps anime adaptation if you want to check it out. 

Probably try to pick it up again one day when I'm really sad and loose all hope in love. Until then, got to savor it for a rainy day.
# What's next
There are many great work I want to read in the future. Unfortunately, I rarely got in the mood to read something serious. Most of the time, I read average stuffs just for entertainment. This is also my last summer before graduating from uni. I'm not sure if I could find the time once I start working.

What's shojo currently on my list
- Chihayafuru
- Natsume book of friends
- Basara
- 7 seeds
- Skip beat
- Nana
- Cardcaptor Sakura

These are all incredibly long and require huge commitment. I know its worth it, just need to find the time.
# What I realize
Every demographic has something to offer. This experience make me very excited to read some Josei manga one day. I'm sure it will fill with profound stories like with Seinen. Maybe even check out some BL manga one day. I heard that 10 dance and banana fish is great. That's it. I hope you enjoy reading my thoughts. Have a nice day!!
